		<h1>Saving Commands</h1>
		<p>GDTerminal allows you to save an unlimited number of code samples ("commands") for quick future use.</p>
		<h2>Saving a Command</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Write the code you want to save in the main view</li>
			<li>Open the saved commands panel</li>
			<li>Click <kbd>Add Current Command</kbd></li>
			<li>Optionally rename the command to help yourself identify it later</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Using Saved Commands</h2>
		<p>In the saved commands panel, to the right of each command's name, there are three buttons.</p>

		<h3>Run</h3>
		<p>The <kbd>Run</kbd> button will run the command, just as if you wrote it in the main view and clicked the main run button.</p>
		<p>Any code already written in the main <kbd>CodeEdit</kbd> will <b>not</b> be cleared.</p>

		<h3>Load</h3>
		<p>The <kbd>Load</kbd> button will copy the command and load it into the main view, clearing any existing code.</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>You may press <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd> when the main <kbd>CodeEdit</kbd> is focused to recover the code you had previously.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Delete</h3>
		<p>The <kbd>Delete</kbd> button will mark the command as deleted. When pressed, it will change into an <kbd>Undo</kbd> button, which can be pressed again to recover the command.</p>
		<p>Commands will only be deleted when the saved commands panel is closed, giving you a chance to recover them in case you accidentally click delete.</p>

		<h2>Editing Saved Commands</h2>
		<p>There is not currently a way to <em>edit</em> saved commands, but you can follow the steps below to reach the same goal:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open the saved commands panel</li>
			<li>Load the command you would like to edit</li>
			<li>Make your changes to the command</li>
			<li>Re-open the saved commands panel</li>
			<li>Click <kbd>Add Current Command</kbd></li>
			<li>Give the new command the same name as the old command</li>
			<li>Delete the old command</li>
		</ol>
